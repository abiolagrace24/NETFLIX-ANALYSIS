I'm sharing a quick but meaningful project I put together to explore and analyze Netflix’s content catalog using real-world data.

# NETFLIX-ANALYSIS 📊🍿

## Problem
Netflix has a massive library of content—but how much of it is actually diverse in terms of country, genre, and release year? Are there trends in what gets added over time? This project began as a curiosity to answer those questions using Python and pandas.

## What I Did
Using a dataset of Netflix titles, I dug into questions like:
- Which countries dominate the content library?
- What genres are most common?
- How has the number of releases evolved over time?
- Is there a balance between TV shows and movies?

I cleaned the data (lots of missing values and inconsistent formatting!), explored patterns using grouping and value counts, and visualized key insights using matplotlib and seaborn.

One thing I was really intentional about was not just running code—but actually interpreting what it means. For example, when I saw India ranking high for content, I dug deeper into release trends and genres. Little things like that helped me go from raw numbers to real insights.

## Why It Matters
This wasn’t just about Netflix—it was an exercise in working with messy data, asking the right questions, and turning analysis into a story. If you're a recruiter reading this, what I hope this shows is that I care about both the technical work and the why behind it.

Let’s talk more if you want someone who doesn’t just write code, but genuinely loves finding answers in data.
